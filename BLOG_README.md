# Blog Management Guide

This guide explains how to easily add blog posts to your portfolio website.

## Quick Start

Your blog section is currently empty and shows a "Coming Soon" page. To add your first blog post:

1. Open `lib/blog-data.ts`
2. Uncomment the template in the `blogPosts` array
3. Fill in your blog details
4. Your blog will automatically appear on the website!

## Adding a New Blog Post

### Step 1: Open the Blog Data File
```
frontend/lib/blog-data.ts
```

### Step 2: Add Your Post
Find the `blogPosts` array and add a new post object:

```typescript
export const blogPosts: BlogPost[] = [
  {
    id: 1, // Unique ID for your post
    title: "My First Blog Post",
    excerpt: "A brief description of what readers will learn...",
    content: `
      # My First Blog Post
      
      Write your full blog content here using markdown format.
      
      ## Introduction
      Start with an engaging introduction...
      
      ## Main Content
      Your detailed content goes here...
      
      ## Conclusion
      Wrap up your thoughts...
    `,
    tags: ["React", "NextJS", "Learning"], // Add relevant tags
    publishedAt: "2024-01-15", // Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    readTime: "5 min read", // Estimated reading time
    featured: true, // Set to true to feature this post prominently
    slug: "my-first-blog-post", // Optional: URL-friendly version of title
  },
  // Add more posts here...
];
```

### Step 3: Save and Your Blog is Live!
That's it! Your blog post will automatically appear on your website.

## Content Writing Tips

### Use Markdown Format
Your blog content supports markdown formatting:

```markdown
# Main Title
## Section Title
### Subsection

**Bold text**
*Italic text*

- Bullet points
1. Numbered lists

`code snippets`

```javascript
// Code blocks with syntax highlighting
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

Links: [text](url)
Images: ![alt text](image-url)
```

### Featured vs Regular Posts
- **Featured posts**: Displayed prominently with large cards
- **Regular posts**: Listed in a compact format below featured posts
- You can have multiple featured posts

### Tags
Use relevant tags to help categorize your posts:
- Technical tags: "React", "Python", "Database", "API"
- Project tags: "Full-Stack", "Backend", "Frontend"
- Learning tags: "Tutorial", "Guide", "Tips"

## Example Blog Topics

Based on your projects, here are some blog ideas:

### Technical Deep-Dives
- "Building a CNN from Scratch in Rust"
- "Implementing Payment Systems with FastAPI"
- "Database Optimization for University Systems"

### Project Stories
- "From Idea to 300+ Registrations: Building the MUN Website"
- "Reducing Infrastructure Costs by 55%: A Case Study"
- "Handling 600+ Students: Scaling the Student Council Platform"

### Learning & Growth
- "My Journey from Beginner to Full-Stack Developer"
- "Lessons from Building Production Applications"
- "Why I Chose Rust for Machine Learning"

## File Structure

```
frontend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/blog/page.tsx          # Main blog page component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/blog-data.ts           # Your blog posts data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BLOG_README.md            # This guide
```
